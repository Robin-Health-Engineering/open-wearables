"""Route-level tests for the Withings Mobile SDK endpoints.

The service layer is covered elsewhere; what is only true at the route is covered here — and
one of those things is load-bearing enough that the docstring says so in capitals.

``GET /providers/withings/sdk/session`` resolves the access token FIRST and reads the SDK
account SECOND, because resolving the token may refresh it and a refresh ROTATES the
csrf_token. Read the account first and the response carries the pre-rotation value: valid
looking, and rejected by Withings at WebView-open time, far from the call that caused it.
Nothing about that ordering is visible in a diff, which is exactly why it needs a test that
fails when someone tidies it.

The ordering test asserts the ORDER OF THE CALLS rather than the value in the response.
Mutating the account row would not discriminate: the route builds its response from the ORM
object at the end either way, and SQLAlchemy's identity map hands back the same instance, so a
reordered route would still read the rotated value and the test would pass while the invariant
was broken.

class TestCellularOrderDetailRoute:
    """``GET /withings/cellular/orders/{customer_ref_id}`` — where a device MAC comes from.

    The MAC is the field with money attached. ``Devicev2-endpartnerprogram`` ends a member's
    cellular plan and is addressed by MAC address; ``end_program`` has been written and
    unreachable since #7 because nothing produced one. The ``createuserorder`` response carries no
    MAC, this fork stores none, and Withings populate them only once the parcel has shipped — so
    this route is the first link in the chain that ends a plan, and without it a member who leaves
    keeps costing us a SIM every month.
